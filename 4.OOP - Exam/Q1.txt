Q1. Define the four concepts of OOP with short explain?

1- Encapsulation: 
	it's mean the ability of hide or show the data by using Access modifier
	- puplic: we can access the public data in the class or in any another place
	- private: we can access the private data in the class only
	- protected: we can access the protected data in main class and itsâ€™ child but we cannot access 	  it in main class.

2- Inheritance: 
	It allow us to create a new classes from the existing and the new class called "child class"
	and the existing class called "parent class" and the chlid class also inherite all data
	member from the parent class and the child class can modify the inherited parent' methods

3- Abstraction:
	It is an Interface describes the behavior of the class without any implementation of 
	that class. 

4- Polymorphism:
	the ability of object to having many forms so objects with common parent 
	may have the same name of function but with different behaviors at run time.
