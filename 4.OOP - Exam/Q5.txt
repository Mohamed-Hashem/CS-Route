Q5. What is the difference between Overloading and Overriding?

Overriding => A rewritten function in child class with the same name of another function 
	in parent class and with the same signature (Number of parameters, Type of parameters) 
	and its processing happened in run time (Run Time Polymorphism).

Overloading => A rewritten function with the same name of another function but with 
	different signature (Number of parameters, Type of parameters) and its processing
	happened in compile time (Compile Time Polymorphism).
