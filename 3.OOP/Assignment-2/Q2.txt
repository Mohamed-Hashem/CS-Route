// What is the Difference between composition vs inheritance with example by code


Both compositionand inheritance are object - oriented programming concepts.

==> Composition  implement has - a relationship between objects.

==> Inheritance  implement is - a relationship between objects.


(example)
if we have a class called vehicle

vehicle has an engine, a tire ----->  (has a) relationship -----> This is called composition
when we use class engine or tire -----> we make an object from it inside the class of vehicle

if we make another class called car -----> car is a vehicle ----> (is a) relationship ----> this is called Inheritance

when we use class car ----> we make class car :public vehicle
Inheritance ----> is useful for code reusability : reuse attributesand methods of an existing class when you create a new class.

class Tire {};
class Engine {};

class vehicle
{
	Tire t;		//composition
	Engine e;		//composition
};

class car : public vehicle	//inheritance
{
public:
	car() : vehicle() {
	}
};
